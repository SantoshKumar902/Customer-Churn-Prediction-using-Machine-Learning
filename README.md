# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Business Problem
Customer churn directly impacts revenue and long-term business sustainability. 
The objective of this project is to predict customers at high risk of churn and 
identify the key factors influencing churn behavior to support data-driven 
retention strategies.

## Dataset
- Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle)
- Records: ~7,000 customers
- Target Variable: Churn (Yes / No)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Evaluation Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering (tenure groups, charge flags)
4. Model training and comparison
5. Model evaluation and interpretation
6. Business insight generation

## Key Insights
- Month-to-month contract customers show significantly higher churn
- Short-tenure customers are more likely to churn
- Higher monthly charges increase churn probability

## Business Recommendations
- Incentivize long-term contracts for high-risk customers
- Offer personalized discounts to high-charge customers
- Improve onboarding experience for first-year customers

## Results
- Random Forest model outperformed baseline models
- ROC-AUC score demonstrated strong predictive capability

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of advanced data analytics and 
predictive modeling techniques to solve a real-world business problem and 
derive actionable insights.
